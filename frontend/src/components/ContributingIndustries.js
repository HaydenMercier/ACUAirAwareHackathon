Coal power plants contribute the most, burning over 8 billion tons of coal every year, pumping out sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and tiny particles that we breathe in. This pollution causes smog in cities, acid rain, and serious breathing problems for millions of people. Coal plants also release mercury, a toxic metal that can damage children\'s brain development. Natural gas plants are cleaner than coal but can still cause problems through methane leaks during drilling and transport, methane traps 28 times more heat than carbon dioxide. Oil refineries also release chemicals like benzene and other compounds that create smog and increase the risk of cancer in nearby communities.',

Diesel vehicles are especially bad as they produce tiny particles that penetrate our lungs, causing heart disease, strokes, and lung cancer. Diesel trucks and buses produce 40 times more nitrogen oxides than regular cars, which is why city air is often so polluted. Planes are also a problem too, releasing pollution high in the atmosphere where it has a stronger impact on the greenhouse effect. Ships that carry goods around the world burn dirty fuel oil that contains lots of sulfur, creating pollution that affects coastal cities and makes the ocean more acidic.',

Making one ton of steel needs 1.4 tons of coal and releases toxic dust and gases that make people sick in steel-making areas. Cement production is also a major problem because it releases carbon dioxide both from burning fuel and from the chemical process of breaking down limestone. Chemical factories release many toxic compounds including benzene and formaldehyde, which can cause cancer and create smog. Making aluminum requires massive amounts of electricity and releases some of the most powerful greenhouse gases, some of which remain in the atmosphere for over 10,000 years and trap huge amounts of heat, contributing to global warming.',

Landfills produce methane gas as garbage rots, contributing 11% of all methane emissions worldwide. This gas production continues for decades after trash is buried, making landfills long-term pollution sources. Waste incinerators burn trash to reduce volume but release extremely toxic chemicals including dioxins (some of the most poisonous substances known), mercury, lead, and tiny particles that can travel far and build up in our food. These facilities are often built in poor neighborhoods, unfairly exposing these communities to more pollution. Around 2.6 billion people worldwide burn their trash in the open because they don\'t have proper waste collection, creating toxic smoke that causes immediate breathing problems and long-term health issues. Even recycling facilities create pollution through plastic particles, chemical vapours, and produce less air pollution than garbage dumps, but this shows we need to focus more on reducing waste rather than just managing it,.',

          <div className="action-item">
            <h4>Install Solar Panels</h4>
            <p>Switch from coal-powered electricity to solar energy. Government subsidies can reduce installation costs by 30-50%, and solar panels typically pay for themselves within 6-10 years through lower electricity bills. Solar energy produces zero emissions compared to coal power, which releases 2.2 billion tons of CO‚ÇÇ annually.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="action-item">
            <h4>Choose Electric or Hybrid Vehicles</h4>
            <p>Replace gasoline cars with electric vehicles to eliminate direct emissions. EVs produce 60% fewer emissions than gas cars over their lifetime, even accounting for electricity generation. Many governments offer tax incentives up to $7,500 for EV purchases.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="action-item">
            <h4>Use LED Light Bulbs</h4>
            <p>Replace incandescent bulbs with LEDs, which use 75% less energy and last 25 times longer. A typical household can save $75 annually on electricity bills while reducing CO‚ÇÇ emissions by 1,000 pounds per year.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="action-item">
            <h4>Buy Local and Organic Food</h4>
            <p>Choose locally grown, organic produce to reduce transportation emissions and pesticide use. Local food travels 27 times less distance than conventional food, cutting transportation-related CO‚ÇÇ emissions significantly.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="action-item">
            <h4>Use Eco-Friendly Cleaning Products</h4>
            <p>Switch to plant-based, biodegradable cleaners that don't release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into your home air. These products reduce indoor air pollution and prevent harmful chemicals from entering waterways.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="action-item">
            <h4>Install a Programmable Thermostat</h4>
            <p>Smart thermostats can reduce heating and cooling energy use by 10-15%, saving $180 annually while cutting CO‚ÇÇ emissions. They automatically adjust temperature when you're away, optimizing energy efficiency.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="action-item">
            <h4>Choose Reusable Products</h4>
            <p>Replace single-use items with reusable alternatives like water bottles, shopping bags, and food containers. This reduces plastic waste that releases toxic chemicals when burned in incinerators or decomposing in landfills.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="action-item">
            <h4>Use Public Transportation</h4>
            <p>Take buses, trains, or bikes instead of driving alone. Public transit produces 45% fewer CO‚ÇÇ emissions per passenger mile than private vehicles. A single bus can replace 40 cars on the road during peak hours.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="action-item">
            <h4>Plant Trees and Gardens</h4>
            <p>Plant native trees and maintain gardens to absorb CO‚ÇÇ from the atmosphere. A mature tree absorbs 48 pounds of CO‚ÇÇ annually, while home gardens reduce the need for transported produce and provide natural air filtration.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="action-item">
            <h4>Choose Energy-Efficient Appliances</h4>
            <p>Buy ENERGY STAR certified appliances that use 10-50% less energy than standard models. An efficient refrigerator can save $300 over its lifetime while preventing 3,000 pounds of CO‚ÇÇ emissions annually.</p>
