# üåç Pollution Simulator Demo Guide

## Quick Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Industrial City
**Objective**: Create a heavily industrialized area and observe pollution patterns

**Steps**:
1. Drag 2-3 **Manufacturing** üè≠ facilities to the center of the map
2. Add 1 **Non-Renewable Power Plant** ‚ö° nearby
3. Place a **Population Center** üèòÔ∏è adjacent to the industrial area
4. Observe the red/purple pollution hotspot forming
5. **Expected AQI**: 150-250 (Unhealthy to Very Unhealthy)

**Right-click Demo**:
- Right-click on the power plant
- Edit properties: Increase capacity to 1000MW
- Notice how pollution intensity increases

### Scenario 2: Green Mitigation
**Objective**: Show how natural features can improve air quality

**Starting from Scenario 1**:
1. Drag **Forests** üå≤ around the industrial area
2. Add a **Lake** üèûÔ∏è or **River** üåä nearby
3. Place **Mountains** ‚õ∞Ô∏è on the windward side
4. Watch the pollution levels decrease
5. **Expected AQI**: 80-120 (Moderate to Unhealthy for Sensitive)

### Scenario 3: Renewable Energy Transition
**Objective**: Compare renewable vs non-renewable energy impacts

**Setup**:
1. Place 3 **Non-Renewable Power Plants** ‚ö° in a row
2. Note the high pollution levels (AQI ~200+)
3. Replace them with **Renewable Power** üå± facilities
4. Add more renewable plants to see negative pollution effect
5. **Expected AQI**: 30-50 (Good)

### Scenario 4: Valley Pollution Trap
**Objective**: Demonstrate topographical effects on air quality

**Steps**:
1. Create a **Valley** üèîÔ∏è in the center
2. Place **Manufacturing** üè≠ and **Mining** ‚õèÔ∏è operations inside
3. Add **Population Centers** üèòÔ∏è in the valley
4. Observe how pollution gets trapped and concentrated
5. **Expected AQI**: 200-300+ (Very Unhealthy to Hazardous)

**Mitigation**:
- Add **Mountains** ‚õ∞Ô∏è to create air flow
- Place **Forests** üå≤ on valley slopes

### Scenario 5: Coastal Clean Air
**Objective**: Show oceanic air purification effects

**Steps**:
1. Place **Ocean** üåä along one edge of the map
2. Add moderate industrial activity inland
3. Notice the gradient from clean coastal air to polluted inland areas
4. **Expected AQI**: 40-80 near coast, 100+ inland

## Interactive Features Demo

### Zoom and Scale Demo:
1. Start at 100% zoom
2. Zoom in to 200% - notice scale changes from "100 km" to "50 km"
3. Zoom out to 50% - scale shows "200 km"
4. Use pan to explore different areas

### Property Editing Demo:
1. Place a **Population Center** üèòÔ∏è
2. Right-click ‚Üí Edit Properties
3. Change population from 10,000 to 100,000
4. Increase intensity from 1 to 3
5. Observe significant pollution increase

### Real-time Calculation Demo:
1. Start with clean map (AQI ~50)
2. Drag a **Mining Operation** ‚õèÔ∏è onto the map
3. Watch AQI jump to ~85 immediately
4. Add more industries and see real-time updates
5. Remove items and watch pollution decrease

## Educational Talking Points

### Industry Impact Comparison:
- **Non-Renewable Power** (90 AQI): "Coal and gas plants are major pollution sources"
- **Mining** (85 AQI): "Extraction operations release significant particulates"
- **Manufacturing** (75 AQI): "Industrial processes contribute to urban air pollution"
- **Agriculture** (25 AQI): "Farming has moderate impact, mainly from dust and ammonia"

### Natural Mitigation Effects:
- **Forests** (-30 AQI): "Trees filter air and produce oxygen"
- **Oceans** (-25 AQI): "Large water bodies create clean air masses"
- **Mountains** (-20 AQI): "Elevation promotes air circulation and dispersion"

### Urban Planning Insights:
- Keep heavy industry downwind from population centers
- Use green belts to buffer industrial areas
- Consider topography when planning industrial zones
- Coastal areas naturally have cleaner air

## Advanced Demo Techniques

### Pollution Gradient Visualization:
1. Create a line of industries across the map
2. Observe how pollution spreads in circles around each source
3. Notice how overlapping circles create higher pollution zones

### Influence Radius Demonstration:
1. Place an industry and right-click to select it
2. Notice the white circle showing its influence radius
3. Edit properties to increase intensity
4. Observe how the influence radius expands

### Comparative Analysis:
1. Create two identical industrial setups
2. Add natural features to only one side
3. Compare AQI readings between the two areas
4. Demonstrate quantitative pollution reduction

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Performance Tips:
- If simulation slows down, reduce number of placed items
- Use zoom controls instead of browser zoom
- Clear all items periodically to reset simulation

### Visual Clarity:
- Use zoom to see detailed pollution patterns
- Pan to explore different areas of the map
- Check the scale indicator for distance reference

### Understanding Results:
- AQI values are cumulative from all sources
- Negative values from natural features reduce overall pollution
- Distance matters - closer items have stronger influence

## Key Learning Outcomes

After completing these demos, users should understand:
1. **Relative pollution impacts** of different industries
2. **Mitigation potential** of natural features
3. **Spatial relationships** between pollution sources and receptors
4. **Cumulative effects** of multiple pollution sources
5. **Real-world applications** for urban planning and environmental policy

## Next Steps

Encourage users to:
1. Create their own scenarios based on real cities
2. Experiment with different mitigation strategies
3. Test extreme scenarios (all industry vs all natural)
4. Share interesting configurations with others
5. Apply learnings to real-world environmental discussions
